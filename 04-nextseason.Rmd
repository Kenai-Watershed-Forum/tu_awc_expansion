# 2022 Fieldwork Plans

## 2022 Anadromous habitat surveys

Fieldwork described in this report will continue in July - September 2022. A minimum of five additional fieldwork days will be supervised by KWF staff, with specific dates to be determined.

Fieldwork dates will generally be on weekend days, and will be selected based on availability of Trout Unlimited volunteers. KWF will announce proposed fieldwork days in April 2022 and send them to the Kenai Peninsula Trout Unlimited president. If interest is sufficient, KWF will again offer a half-day training workshop for volunteers.

A list of proposed 2022 field survey sites was updated in January 2022 and is maintained in the project online database [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S0hwY4EQo9Xtz5d4UnSBCbZoJ0ft_HGQrarfmA5dwNY/edit?usp=sharing) (see the tab titled "E_All_Sites"). These sites are visible in the project map as open red circles (see section 2.1 [Site selection]).
