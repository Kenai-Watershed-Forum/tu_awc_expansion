## Fish capture

During fieldwork in summer 2021 - 2023:

-   Over course of `r n_days` fieldwork days 2021 - 2023 (including the training event), we conducted a total of `r n_events` sampling events at `r n_sites_total` unique sites. See the interactive project map in the Methods section ("[Site selection](##%20Site%20selection)") for a current map of where and when sampling events have occurred. [MAP WILL BE UPDATED FOR 2023]

-   Table \@ref(tab:site-visits) summarises total samping events by individual site. We typically sampled a site only one time each.

-   We have captured `r fish_ct` fish comprised of `r spp_ct` unique species. Table \@ref(tab:ct) summarizes current fish capture count by species.

-   Table \@ref(tab:site-spp-ct) summarizes total fish capture for each species by site.

```{r, site-visits, echo = F, fig.cap = "cap"}
n_sites %>%
  kbl(caption = "Total site visits") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

#, 
 #             bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

# fix w/ webshot or make non-html
```

```{r ct, echo = F, fig.cap = "Total fish capture count by species"}

spp_ct_n %>%
  kbl(caption = "Total fish capture count by species") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
#, 
 #             bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

## AWC Nominations

Fish capture data was evaluated against the 2022 Anadromous Waters Catalog to identify new stream segment nominations. Complete submission materials may be accessed in the project [Google Drive folder (link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VygMPNtLJvRrKFhdDC77fmSIETm_mmtg?usp=share_link). Nominations were sent to the ADF&G Habitat Division in Anchorage in September 2022.

A total length of **3.51 miles** of stream segments were included in the nominations from fieldwork supported by KPTU activities. Table \@ref(tab:awc-noms) breaks down each nomination by length. Figure \@ref(fig:awc-noms-map)

```{r, awc-noms, echo = F, fig.cap = "cap"}

### sample events
read_sheet(url, sheet =  "awc_nominations") %>%
  select(-project_org,-year) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Site)) %>%
  kbl(caption = "AWC Nominations") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

```

```{r, awc-noms-map, echo = F, fig.cap = "map map"}

## Aquatic Resource Permit
Fish capture data was reformatted each fall in to a csv file for submission to ADF&G in fulfillment of the required [Aquatic Resource Permit](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=otherlicense.aquatic_reports)[^02-results-1]; available in the online in [this project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/Kenai-Watershed-Forum/tu_awc_expansion/tree/main/output)[^02-results-2].
